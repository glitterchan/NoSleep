# *Lyn’s Levels of Insomnia* 
-# (LLI)

-# Written on `09/13/2024`
-# *On 27 hours of no sleep*
### Level List
-# Note: Accurate to science ||(excl. Lvl 1’s range)|| but in my own words.
### Level 1
-# 12-24 hours *(Boring Stages)*

**Symptoms:**
```Completely Variable - 
Depends on the person and will most likely feel like a normal day.```
* Note 1 - This level is boring.

### Level 2
-# 24-36 hours *(Early Stages)*

**Symptoms:**
```First Signs of Extreme Tiredness -
This also depends on the person, but is much more predictable and reproducible than Level 1. You WILL be tired by this point or for at least for the majority.```
* Note 2 - This is when things first start feeling shitty, especially in the later hours of the night.
* Note 3 - “__You will be tired by this point or at least for the majority__.” ‘Majority’ as in specifically the night, early morning, evening, and night hours. I personally wake up a couple hours into the day and everything feels pretty normal. (It’s 1:50 pm while I type this sentence and I feel normal).

### Level :3 ||*(typo real)*||
-# 36-48 hours *(The Dark Stages)*

**Symptoms:**
```The Most PAINFUL Level - 
Seriously! There’s a reason why I put as much emphasis on “PAINFUL” as discord allows me to do. Not sleeping will really be making you suffer by this point, and you will very likely begin the fascinating experience (you’re not even aware of) called microsleep.```
* Note 4 - If you haven’t been this far before, this will actually be painful. It will feel like you’re in moderate to high pain at all times, except it’s the sleep pain and your mind is begging you to sleep everything second.

-# **DISCLAIMER** - THIS GUIDE IS WRITTEN FOR PEOPLE WHO START THE EXPERIMENT AT A MORNING HOUR. 
-# I only have experience from starting from a night’s sleep then going from there. 

-# **Extra Notes:** ||4:30-8:00 am is the range of when I start tracking, so this *should* be most accurate for people who wake up in that time window.||
